ðŸ§ª JM Bone Highlight Tool â€“ Test Notes
1. Installation Check

 Place all .lua files in Scripts/tool/JM_BoneTools/.

 Restart Moho.

 Confirm that the Bone Highlight Tool shows up in the Bone tools palette.

 Open a bone layer â†’ verify the tool is enabled only for bone layers.

2. Highlighting

 With a bone layer selected, drag the mouse across several bones.

 Verify that bones inside the drag rectangle highlight in yellow.

 Press ESC (if enabled) â†’ all highlights clear.

 Toggle Enable Clear All w/ ESC â†’ confirm ESC only clears when toggle is ON.

3. Sync With Moho Selection

 Select bones in Moho normally â†’ turn on Sync With Moho Selection.

 Highlight should match Mohoâ€™s selection.

 Deselect in Moho â†’ highlights clear accordingly.

 Toggle OFF â†’ highlighting works independently.

 Verify checkbox turns purple when ON and red when OFF.

4. Bone Strength

 Highlight bones.

 Enter a number into Bone Strength (default should be 0.0).

 Press Enter â†’ confirm all highlighted bones adopt that strength value.

 Change value again â†’ bones update immediately.

 Verify you can type floats (e.g. 0.5, 1.25).

5. Clone + Mirror

 Highlight a bone or set of bones.

 Press Clone â†’ bones duplicate in place.

 Press Clone + Mirror â†’ bones mirror to the opposite side.

 Try each Mirror Axis option:

Horizontal (Y Axis)

Vertical (X Axis)

Custom X (enter a custom X coordinate, e.g. 5.0)

6. Clone Count

 Highlight bones.

 Set Clone Count = 1 â†’ verify only one set of clones created.

 Increase to 3 â†’ three distinct copies appear.

 Verify each clone is independent (not linked).

7. Offset Options

 Highlight bones.

 Toggle Enable Offset ON.

 Set Offset X = 2.0, Offset Y = 1.0.

 Clone â†’ new bones appear shifted by (2,1).

 Set Offset Mode = Fixed â†’ all clones shifted by same amount.

 Set Offset Mode = Incremental â†’ each additional clone shifts more (e.g. clone 1 = (2,1), clone 2 = (4,2)).

 Toggle OFF â†’ cloning returns to no offset.

8. Group Management (Bone Library)

 Highlight bones â†’ save them to a new folder/group.

 Verify group is added under the UI.

 Save multiple groups â†’ confirm they appear under different folders.

 Close Moho and reopen â†’ groups persist (check JM_BoneGroups_data.lua was created/updated).

 Load a group into a new project â†’ bones appear with correct names, strengths, and settings.

9. Mirror Groups

 Save a set of bones (e.g., Right Arm).

 Clone + Mirror that group â†’ verify Left Arm is generated correctly.

 Check that names are suffixed properly (e.g., _mirror1, _mirror2).

10. General Behavior

 Verify tool does not work in non-bone layers.

 Check UI responsiveness (no crashes when toggling options).

 Test multiple workflows in sequence (highlight â†’ set strength â†’ clone â†’ offset â†’ save group).
